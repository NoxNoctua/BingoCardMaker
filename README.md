There is an issue with how the uv package manager parses compresstion and archive that make it un able to install the borb library

Solution:

- Open terminal in project folder
- Activate enviroment: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- add borb using pip instead of uv: `python -m pip install borb`

If there is a `no modual named pip` error make sure to run `uv sync` and or `uv add --dev pip`
